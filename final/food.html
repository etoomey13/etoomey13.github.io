				<h3>Convive Coffee Roastery</h3>
					<img src="images/convive.JPG" alt="Convive Coffee Roastery image" height="300" width="225">
					<p>Coffee has become an American favorite in recent years, but getting coffee isn't just about the beverage itself. It's about the experience of catching up with friends over a cup of joe or geetting the caffeine boost you need to crank out a big project at work. <a href="https://www.convivecoffee.com/">Convive Coffee Roastery</a> provides you with both.</p>
					
					<p>Owners Ryland and Katie Weber opened their first Convive cafe in McCandless Crossing, about twenty minutes north of Pittsburgh, in 2016 and just recently opened a second location in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood. A third location will open soon in Mars, PA.</p>
					
					<p>The cafe puts a big emphasis on community, hence their name Convive which means to eat and drink together. No better place is this sense of community demonstrated than the Pay-It-Forward-Wall where customers can buy a drink for someone else and then pin a coffee sleeve detailing who the drink is for to the wall. If you fit the description on one of the sleeves, bring it to the cash register and enjoy a free drink on your kind neighbor.</p>
					 
					 <p>Convive's menu includes, espresso drinks, iced coffees, loose leaf teas, hot chocolate, and a few pasteries such as cranberry walnut scones and blueberry muffins. Mmm Mmm!</p>
